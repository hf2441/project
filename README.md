# project
 final project for tools for analytics
#description:
There are two Jupyter books(.ipynb) in this project. One is named Top10.ipynb, analyze what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in ZIP code 10027, and calculate how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. 
The other is named Parking.ipynb, analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in ZIP code 10027 than they are in general. Specifically, compute the total number of parking incidents in 10027, and the total number of all incidents -- is this fraction greater than or smaller than the total fraction of parking incidents across all ZIP codes? The answer is in the form of a single bool called `higher_parking_proportion` which is True if 10027 contains a higher proportion of parking incidents than the global value, and False otherwise.
